# Even-Square-and-Odd-Cube

This program is a look a like of the "Odd and Even Extractor," however, this program will create two separate text files after reading the source text file named **integers.txt** that contains 20 integers. The first output file will be named **double.txt** containing the square of all even integers found in integers.txt and the second file will be named **triple.txt** containing the cube of all odd numbers found in the integers.txt.
